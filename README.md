  # Silver Game
  
  *A real-time multimodal emotion analysis platform designed for elderly users, featuring intelligent social interaction, AI emotion detection, and empathetic virtual companions.*
</div>

## üéØ Inspiration

During COVID-19, we witnessed elderly people struggling with digital communication - feeling isolated despite being connected. Traditional chat platforms failed to understand their emotional needs. The key insight: elderly users often struggle to express emotions clearly in text but show genuine feelings through facial expressions. We realized that combining both could create truly empathetic AI companions.

## üöÄ What It Does

SilverLink AI is a real-time multimodal emotion analysis system that:

- **Analyzes text sentiment** using fine-tuned DistilBERT + Google Cloud NLP
- **Recognizes facial emotions** through custom MobileNetV2 models
- **Fuses both inputs** using elderly-optimized algorithms
- **Provides real-time emotion feedback** for chatbots, virtual companions, and healthcare monitoring
- **Enables intelligent user matching** based on emotional compatibility

**Core Innovation**: Our fusion algorithm accounts for elderly communication patterns (like saying "I'm fine" while looking sad) and weights facial expressions higher than text for more accurate emotion detection.

## üèÉ Quick Start

### One-Click Setup (Recommended)

```bash
# Double-click to run the startup script
start.bat
```

The script automatically:
- Detects and installs frontend & backend dependencies
- Starts both servers in parallel

### Using npm Scripts

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies and setup backend environment
npm run setup:backend

# 2. Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev:full
```

## üåê Access URLs

- **Frontend Application**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000  
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **Real-time Video Calls** - High-quality WebRTC-based video communication
- **AI Emotion Analysis** - Intelligent emotion state recognition
- **Virtual Spaces** - Diverse interactive scenarios
- **Smart Chat** - AI assistant conversation capabilities
- **Community Interaction** - User community and social features

## üõ† Tech Stack

**Frontend**:

- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- WebRTC
- Socket.IO

**Backend**:
- FastAPI (Python)
- WebSocket
- PyTorch (Emotion Analysis)
- Uvicorn

## üèó How We Built It

### AI Pipeline

- **Text Analysis**: Fine-tuned DistilBERT on elderly-specific language patterns + Google Cloud NLP for multilingual support
- **Facial Recognition**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2, trained on elderly facial expression datasets
- **Fusion Algorithm**: Confidence-weighted combination with elderly-specific adjustments

### Backend Architecture

- FastAPI microservices deployed on Google Cloud Run
- WebRTC signaling server for real-time video chat
- MongoDB Vector Search for intelligent user matching
- RESTful APIs ready for frontend integration

### Real-time Integration

- WebSocket-based communication for live emotion tracking
- Optimized inference pipeline achieving <1.5s response time
- Docker containerization for scalable deployment

### Core API Example

```python
# POST /api/analyze-emotion
{
  "text": "I'm feeling okay today",
  "image": "base64_encoded_face_image",
  "context": "daily_check"
}

# Response:
{
  "text_sentiment": "neutral",
  "face_emotion": "sad",
  "final_emotion": "concerned",
  "confidence": 0.84,
  "recommendations": ["offer_support", "gentle_conversation"]
}
```

## üß© Challenges We Overcame

1. **Model Optimization**: Large transformer models exceeded Cloud Run memory limits
   - *Solution*: Model distillation and pruning, reduced size by 60% while maintaining accuracy

2. **Elderly-Specific Data Scarcity**: Limited training data for elderly expressions
   - *Solution*: Transfer learning, data augmentation, and synthetic elderly emotion datasets

3. **Fusion Algorithm Complexity**: Text and facial emotions often conflicted
   - *Solution*: Developed "hidden emotion" detection for cases where elderly say "fine" but look distressed

4. **Real-time Performance**: Needed <2s response for live chat integration
   - *Solution*: Parallel processing, efficient model loading, and optimized inference pipeline

## üèÜ What We Learned

- **Multimodal AI requires cultural sensitivity**: Emotion expression varies significantly across cultures and age groups
- **Production AI ‚â† Research AI**: Models need significant optimization for real-world deployment
- **User-centric design is crucial**: Technology must adapt to elderly users, not vice versa
- **Edge cases matter**: Elderly communication patterns differ from typical AI training datasets

## üéØ Roadmap

### Immediate (Next 3 months)
- Complete React frontend with real-time emotion visualization
- Unity 3D virtual companions that respond to user emotions
- Mobile app for elderly users with simplified interfaces

### Future Vision
- Speech emotion recognition for complete multimodal analysis
- Personalized emotion learning over time
- Clinical-grade integration for healthcare monitoring
- Global deployment with multi-cultural emotion understanding

## üîß Manual Setup Guide

If the automatic script encounters issues, follow these manual steps:

### Step 1: Setup Backend Environment

```bash
# 1. Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# 2. Create Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate virtual environment
# Windows Command Prompt:
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell:
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Git Bash:
source venv/Scripts/activate

# 4. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Start Backend Services

```bash
# In backend directory, ensure virtual environment is activated
python -m uvicorn websocket_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### Step 3: Start Frontend (New Terminal)

```bash
# Return to project root directory
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Start frontend development server
npm run dev
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Backend Startup Issues
- Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
- Check if virtual environment is properly activated
- Confirm port 8000 is not occupied

### Frontend Startup Issues  
- Ensure Node.js 16+ is installed
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then `npm install` again
- Confirm port 3000 is not occupied

### Video Call Connection Issues
- Ensure backend server is running
- Check browser console for error messages
- Allow browser access to camera and microphone permissions

### Common Issues

**Issue 1: `No module named uvicorn`**
```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
cd backend
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install uvicorn
```

**Issue 2: Python virtual environment creation fails**
```bash
# Try using full path
python.exe -m venv venv
# Or specify Python version
py -3 -m venv venv
```

**Issue 3: Permission issues (Windows PowerShell)**
```bash
# Temporarily allow script execution
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

**Issue 4: Port occupied**
```bash
# Check port usage
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Use different port
python -m uvicorn websocket_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
```
